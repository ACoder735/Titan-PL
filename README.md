# Titan

**This is the new Titan language, made to be:**
- 🎯 Simple 
- 📖 Readable
- 🔥 Fast
- 🎛 Controllable

**Titan** aims to make a better programming world for coders.

Here are some snippets of Titan code:
```
console.typeln("Hello, World!") // Prints a message
x := 5 // Makes a varible. Can also use Num x = 5 for more control
if x < 10{ // If statement
  console.typeln("x is smaller.")
}
```

```
for x:=0 to 10{ // For loop
  console.typeln(Str(x)) // All types MUST be manually converted.
}
```

**⚠ Important Note: Titan v0.9.0 will be released and ready for use in the 15th of March, 2026.**

**⚠ Important Note: To run Titan, please install GCC (Windows):**
> To compile and run Titan code, you need GCC installed via MSYS2.
> ## Step 1: Install MSYS2
> 
> Go to https://www.msys2.org/.
> 
> Download the installer. `msys2-x86_64-20251213.exe` or `msys2-arm64-20251213.exe` (ARM64)
> 
> Run the installer. Keep the default installation path (C:\msys64).
> 
> Step 2: Install GCC (MinGW-w64)
> 
> Open the "MSYS2 UCRT64" terminal from your Start Menu.
> 
> Run the following command to update the package database:
> ```
> pacman -Syu
> ```
> If the terminal closes, reopen it and run this command to install the GCC compiler toolchain:
> ```
> pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc
> ```
> (Press Y to confirm installation).

# Titan features
- `Titan` compiles directly into C, then into a .EXE, making it very fast.
- `Titan` does not leave clutter in the same place where your projects are.
- Instead, it makes a folder named `TitanProjects` and puts the generated files there.
